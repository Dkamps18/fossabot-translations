# Fossabot Translations

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7e3d4b91-9f8c-4a13-9ef9-0073739ea685/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/fossabot-translations/deploys)

The resource hub for all translations on Fossabot! All translations are stored in JSON files, we host these simply on Netlify and are always open to more translation PRs to aid the effort in translating Fossabot for everyone!

Languages are broken down into their own respectable folders, categorized by their [ISO 639-1 codes](https://ewikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), for example, all English translations are available under `en`.

## Contributions

In order to contribute, we ask that you start basing your new language translation set off of the `en` language, and do it in an applicable branch name, something like `new-language-{COUNTRY_CODE}` or something like that, helps us to keep things organised. Whenever we add a new phrase into a language, it will always be in the `en` language first. We haven't thought of the best way to notify everyone to add the equivalent in their own languages, but are working on it.

## Using the translations

Feel free to use the translations! We simply serve the master branch from Github pages over at [translations.fossabot.com](https://translations.fossabot.com)! These are completely open source.
